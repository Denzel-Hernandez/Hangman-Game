# Hangman Game

A classic **Hangman** game built using **C#**. This terminal-based game offers a challenge to guess a hidden word, letter by letter, with a limited number of incorrect guesses. Players can select a difficulty level that affects the complexity of the word, and they can earn points based on their performance. The game also includes a visual representation of the hangman, and players have the option to use a hint at the cost of one attempt.

## Features
- **Difficulty Level Selection**: Choose between easy, medium, or hard. Word complexity increases with difficulty, while the number of guesses remains the same.
- **Point System**: Earn points based on the number of attempts remaining. Easy mode rewards 40 points, and hard mode rewards 50 points if you win.
- **Hint System**: Use a hint to reveal a letter at the cost of one attempt.
- **Visual Hangman Representation**: The hangman is drawn step by step as incorrect guesses accumulate.
- **Random Word Selection**: Words are randomly selected from a predefined list based on the chosen difficulty level.
- **High Score Tracking**: The game keeps track of the total score and the highest score across multiple rounds.
