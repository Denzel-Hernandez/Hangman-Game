# Hangman Game

A classic **Hangman** game built using **C#**. This terminal-based game challenges players to guess a hidden word, letter by letter, with a limited number of incorrect guesses. Players can choose a difficulty level that affects the complexity of the words, and points are awarded based on the selected difficulty.

## Features
- **Difficulty level selection**: Choose from easy, medium, or hard. The word complexity increases with the difficulty, while the number of allowed incorrect guesses remains the same.
- **Point System**: Earn 40 points for winning on easy and 50 points for winning on hard.
- Terminal-based **user interface**.
- Random word selection from a predefined list.
- Tracks and displays correct and incorrect guesses.
- **Visual representation of the hangman** as incorrect guesses accumulate.
- Win/lose conditions based on correct guesses before the hangman is completed.

## Technologies Used
